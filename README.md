# Iota Seed Generator/Encrypter/Decrypter

The codebase is PHP.

This script allows you to generate a proper IOTA seed and allows you to encrypt the seed and set a password for
decryption.<br /> May a good idea to backup it this way or in case you want to send a seed via email.

Create an IOTA Seed using RandomLib library. A library for generating random numbers and strings of various strengths.
